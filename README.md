# File Sharer MEGA-X 2000 4k

Despite it's name, the _File Sharer MEGA-X 2000 4k_ is a drop-dead simple file uploader for sharing files with clients and others.

## Installation

1. Import db.sql.
2. Edit the config files in /application/config to match your setup and preferences. Rename the *-example.php files by removing the "-example" part.
3. Setup cron to run /cron every 24 hours if you'd like the expired entries to be deleted.

_Requires a modern browser to upload files._
